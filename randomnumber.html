  <h1>Guess the Number Game</h1>
  
  <p>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10. Can you guess what it is?</p>
  
  <form>
    <label for="guess">Enter your guess:</label>
    <input type="number" id="guess" name="guess">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
  
  <script>
    // Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;

    // Keep track of the number of guesses
    let numGuesses = 0;

    // Get references to the form and input elements
    const form = document.querySelector("form");
    const guessInput = document.querySelector("#guess");

    // Add an event listener to the form for when it is submitted
    form.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
      // Prevent the default form submission behavior
      event.preventDefault();

      // Get the user's guess from the input field
      const guess = parseInt(guessInput.value);

      // Clear the input field
      guessInput.value = "";

      // Increment the number of guesses
      numGuesses++;

      // Check if the guess is correct
      if (guess === randomNumber) {
        // The user guessed correctly!
        alert(`Congratulations! You guessed the number ${randomNumber} in ${numGuesses} guesses!`);

        // Remove the form from the page
        form.remove();

        // Add a "Play Again" button
        const playAgainButton = document.createElement("button");
        playAgainButton.innerText = "Play Again";
        playAgainButton.onclick = function() {
          // Reload the page to start a new game
          location.reload();
        };
        document.body.appendChild(playAgainButton);
      } else if (guess < randomNumber) {
        // The user's guess was too low
        alert("Sorry, that guess was too low. Try again.");
      } else {

        alert("Sorry, that guess was too high. Try again.");
