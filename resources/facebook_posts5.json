    "message": "A summary of the meeting on Wednesday 26th January ...\n\nBill worked on Blender creating tree/grass assets to use with Unity\n\nIgor used Fusion360 and adjusted his design of our robot arm support to accommodate the signal connector we'd not seen in the original image. We'll print this on a resin 3D printer and hopefully have something to hold up a camera and, using computer vision, identify and follow a person in a crowded room.\n\nPav and Igor worked on making a robot arm move properly, found where the unfitted gear should be and got everything working nicely.\n\nStoo had managed to get hold of a microbit v2, which Natan had great fun with, using scratch to write programs that tested sound thresholds for triggering responses. \n\nTim had used his Creatility 3D printer to create some tank tracks for a robot tank project we've started to work on, based on an instructables guide. https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-FPV-Arduino-RC-Tank-With-Controller/ The tracks were amazing, printed as a single print the linkages worked, as in moved fairly easily, we'll need to add some grease to make the track move more freely but unbelievable that you can print something with moving parts."

Will test later to see if it's now accepted \n\nThe terrain textures component of Unity was investigated to produce grass in various shades and lighting conditions. Two of the club members worked together, one more experienced and one younger, it was rewarding to see them working collaboratively. \n\nA wifi dongle was fitted and configured on the single linux box we have. This allowed the OS to be updated and used to update one of the members own website."

    "message": "Good news everyone. We will soon be able to continue our Code Club at the Curborough Community centre, who have kindly offered us a slot at 5pm on Wednesdays.\n\nWe did contact Lichfield Library and they issued the following statement regarding the current situation.\n\n                             \n\nThanks for calling into the library about code club today.  I hope you are keeping well. We are currently recovering our services slowly and risk assessing each area.  Unfortunately we cannot offer Code Club at this time as we are unable to offer socially distanced areas with computers for groups.  The session running at Stafford library is Raspberry Jam which is run by an independent group outside of library opening hours.  This is possible as the SP1 building is open during the evening.  Unfortunately this is not possible outside of opening hours in the Lichfield Library space.  Stafford\u2019s Code club is currently not running as they are not able to socially distance in their computer area.\n\nWe would like to re-instate Code Club at some point in the future, but the Staffordshire County Council Winter Plan is following Government guidelines and keeping social distancing, and mask wearing everywhere they can to reduce the Covid 19 risk.  When this changes we will look again at what we can offer.  It is unlikely that this will change until Spring 2022 at the earliest.\n\n===========================================\nIf you would be interested in joining us at Code Club, please leave a comment on this page. Age range is typically 7 - 14yrs old."

Mask wearing was encouraged and there were plenty of hand sanitizer stations dotted around.\nThe night saw around 15 attendees demonstrating various Raspberry Pi projects.\n\nWe are going to approach Lichfield Library in the coming week to see if are able to resume our Code Club meetings.\nI will post the outcome of our meeting as soon as I have any details."

    "message": "Many thanks to Chase Accounting who have donated a number of old PC's to Lichfield Code Club. A few weeks ago we were contacted by Anna Kluk, one of the mum's whose son previously attended our weekly meetings at Lichfield Library, because she'd heard about a company who were looking to donate their old PC's to a worthy cause. After liaising with Councillor Dave Robertson and Sue Woodward we were put in contact with Ken Scott-Clegg at Chase Accounting in Cannock and, after the PC's had been scrubbed to reset them to a fresh start, we collected them just over a week ago.\n\nStewart and I are very happy to see that, even though they're old and maybe not up to scratch for accountancy work, they're perfectly capable of running software to help our members learn how to program. \n\nWe're thinking of installing Scratch, Python and Visual Studio Code.\nWe'll use the non-internet version of Scratch because using the internet version has always had performance issues.\nPython is a popular programming language in great demand in industry, but is also very easy to use at home by someone new to programming.\nVisual Studio Code is free, easy to use IDE also widely used by professional programmers.\n\nWe intend to loan the PC's out to club members who need machines of their own to work on, rather than mum or dad's laptop. We're not adverse to other software being installed because we will restore an image backup once the loan is over and get it ready for the next loan.\n\nLet us know if you would be interested in loaning one of the PC's.\nPlease note that they are small tower desktop systems which will need ethernet cables, there's no wifi adapters.\n\nOnce again, many thanks to Chase Accounting for such a wonderful gesture. We promise to make the most of their generosity.\n\nA special thank you to Anna Kluk, for thinking of us and making this possible.\n\nChase Accounting can be found at http://www.hatepayingtax.co.uk/\n\nLooking forward to when we can meet up again\n\nBest wishes\nStoo and Mark"

This is a social media server that let's us exchange ideas and code. One of our young coders is trying their hand at web design. Check out lichfieldcodeclub.uk \n\nRemember, we have a Club Page on the main Code Club Site, where you can find lots of projects to have a go at. I am going to investigate the possibility of having virtual Code Club meetings on Zoom. This would allow us to see and speak to each other and share ideas and projects. I need to do a bit of research on this first to make sure we stick to the guidelines etc and that we can do this in a safe way that respects your privacy."
