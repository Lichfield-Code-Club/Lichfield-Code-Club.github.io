A few weeks ago we were contacted by Anna Kluk, one of the mum's whose son previously attended our weekly meetings at Lichfield Library, because she'd heard about a company who were looking to donate their old PC's to a worthy cause. After liaising with Councillor Dave Robertson and Sue Woodward we were put in contact with Ken Scott-Clegg at Chase Accounting in Cannock and, after the PC's had been scrubbed to reset them to a fresh start, we collected them just over a week ago.\n\nStewart and I are very happy to see that, even though they're old and maybe not up to scratch for accountancy work, they're perfectly capable of running software to help our members learn how to program. \n\nWe're thinking of installing Scratch, Python and Visual Studio Code.\nWe'll use the non-internet version of Scratch because using the internet version has always had performance issues.\nPython is a popular programming language in great demand in industry, but is also very easy to use at home by someone new to programming.\nVisual Studio Code is free, easy to use IDE also widely used by professional programmers.\n\nWe intend to loan the PC's out to club members who need machines of their own to work on, rather than mum or dad's laptop. We're not adverse to other software being installed because we will restore an image backup once the loan is over and get it ready for the next loan.\n\nLet us know if you would be interested in loaning one of the PC's.\nPlease note that they are small tower desktop systems which will need ethernet cables, there's no wifi adapters.\n\nOnce again, many thanks to Chase Accounting for such a wonderful gesture. We promise to make the most of their generosity.\n\nA special thank you to Anna Kluk, for thinking of us and making this possible.\n\nChase Accounting can be found at http://www.hatepayingtax.co.uk/\n\nLooking forward to when we can meet up again\n\nBest wishes\nStoo and Mark",
