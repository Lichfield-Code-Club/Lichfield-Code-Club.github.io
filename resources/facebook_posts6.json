      "message": "Yesterday's club meeting at Lichfield Library, Tuesday 17th of December, was the last one before the Christmas break. The next will be Tuesday 7th of January 2020.\n\nOne youngster used scratch to create a Christmas scene with a countryside back drop, a central doughnut and holly in each of the corners. We made the holly move in towards the doughnut and back out to the corners, and so hopefully gained some insight into screen coordinates and forever loops.\n\nAnother youngster connected to YouTube and played Christmas music, which the library staff said was okay on this occasion. This got everyone into festive spirit .\n\nTwo other youngsters worked independently on their own scratch based project and seem to be doing well making objects move around a maze.\n\nLast, but not least, another youngster was keen to push forward with using repl.it to create his own maze based python program but we found that it did not allow key presses to be captured and acted upon, a limitation of using a cloud based service. To overcome this we will need to download Python for Windows onto his laptop. This can be found at https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ .\nFor those who want to make games please download the latest version, 3.8.0. During the installation there are options to download it 'for everyone' and that's the best option. You also should install a desktop icon and the pip program. Any questions please ask here or in person next time we meet.\n\nHope you all have a great Christmas, enjoy coding and feel free to ask questions. See you all in 2020.",

The site lets you create programs in C#, C++, C, Python, Java, JavaScript and many more.\nWe looked at defining functions,  looping through lists and lists of list to create a maze program and started to add keyboard interaction.\nAnother lad looked at using pygame, but the startup learning curve was quite steep and so next time we'll provide a skeletal game and add functionality.\nThank you to all who came and look forward to seeing you next week.",
