The members liked the way the drones could avoid obstacles, rising over hedges and tress. The 'follow' feature was entertaining how the drones could follow people even whilst they ran as fast as they could. Tried using a cheaper drone in the community centre's large hall but it refused to do what had been prepared, very frustrating. Some progress made on unity graphics and debugging pong (again).",

Here's Bill's ...\n\nBill, Tomasz, and Natan experimented with movement and sound pitching in Unity and tested their colourblindness\nThe results are as follows:\nBill: 4/100\nTomasz: 2/100\nNatan: 25/100\" (edited)\nOctober 5, 2022\n\nDebugging the Pong game progressed considerably, borders were created, ball movement was corrected. All in all a very useful 'debugging' session.\n\nWe're looking forward to Igor being able to help out again. He's back from Poland and keen to get involved again.\n\nAgain, thank you Bill for taking some photos this week \ud83d\udc4d",
