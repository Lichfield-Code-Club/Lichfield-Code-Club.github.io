It kept restarting, so Bill was unable to make any progress on his tree objects. However, he and Stoo had last weeks version and were able to integrate it with Stoo's Oculus VR (Virtual Reality) head set and they had some fun moving around the virtual scene. \n\nTim made great progress on the Robot tank and the main body is now assembled. The motors are next. Unfortunately we didn't have the exact motors that the design called for and the motor spindles are a little shorter than expected. Tim will investigate heating the locking nut hot enough tho melt the PLA (plastic) and embed it in the cog that it needs to hold. \n\nPav and Natan further investigated minecraft anti-cheats and now Stoo and I have a reasonable grasp over what they are and why they're needed. \n\nGreat support, as always, from the community centre staff and mums. Thank you :-)",

We'll print this on a resin 3D printer and hopefully have something to hold up a camera and, using computer vision, identify and follow a person in a crowded room.\n\nPav and Igor worked on making a robot arm move properly, found where the unfitted gear should be and got everything working nicely.\n\nStoo had managed to get hold of a microbit v2, which Natan had great fun with, using scratch to write programs that tested sound thresholds for triggering responses. \n\nTim had used his Creatility 3D printer to create some tank tracks for a robot tank project we've started to work on, based on an instructables guide. https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-FPV-Arduino-RC-Tank-With-Controller/ The tracks were amazing, printed as a single print the linkages worked, as in moved fairly easily, we'll need to add some grease to make the track move more freely but unbelievable that you can print something with moving parts.",

We will soon be able to continue our Code Club at the Curborough Community centre, who have kindly offered us a slot at 5pm on Wednesdays.\n\nWe did contact Lichfield Library and they issued the following statement regarding the current situation.\n\n                             \n\nThanks for calling into the library about code club today.  I hope you are keeping well. We are currently recovering our services slowly and risk assessing each area.  Unfortunately we cannot offer Code Club at this time as we are unable to offer socially distanced areas with computers for groups.  The session running at Stafford library is Raspberry Jam which is run by an independent group outside of library opening hours.  This is possible as the SP1 building is open during the evening.  Unfortunately this is not possible outside of opening hours in the Lichfield Library space.  Stafford\u2019s Code club is currently not running as they are not able to socially distance in their computer area.\n\nWe would like to re-instate Code Club at some point in the future, but the Staffordshire County Council Winter Plan is following Government guidelines and keeping social distancing, and mask wearing everywhere they can to reduce the Covid 19 risk.  When this changes we will look again at what we can offer.  It is unlikely that this will change until Spring 2022 at the earliest.\n\n===========================================\nIf you would be interested in joining us at Code Club, please leave a comment on this page. Age range is typically 7 - 14yrs old.",
