I have more time to work on projects than at school which is never in much detail\n\nIgor, age 20\nI helped people out with problems regarding different softwares\n\nPaul, parent\nCoding club is a great way for my boys to concentrate on programming computers. Here, they can focus without distraction and receive expert and friendly advice.\n\nNatan, age 11\nI'm making a montage. I like code club because we get to code and experiment and destroy computers (digitally).\n\nBill, age 13\nNatan, Igor, Mark, and Stoo are good friends and Mark and Stoo are both knowledgeable about code which is helpful when I have an issue.\n\nThomasz, age 13\nI have enjoyed learning more about Python language and have used it to draw incredible pictures!\n\nThese cards will be on display at the Cosford Air Show where we hope to promote Code Club and encourage other youngsters to join clubs close to where they live.",

Bill also took some photos of the meeting.\n\nWe got club members to fill in some cards to say what they like about the club and why they come. We'll post those separately.\n\nAll in all another good meeting and looking forward to the next one.",

So we'll do that from home and before the next meeting.\n\nBill has found that his Unity and Blender projects are too large to upload to GitHub so we'll look at Google Drive and similar.\n\nPaul, Thomasz and Aleks had issues trying to get started with the Raspberry Pi Pico and installing micropython. We will also tackle this before the next meeting\n\nAnia was off and Kasia helped us out nicely. Thanks to Kasia we will be able to have a meeting next Tuesday, even though it's half term for many schools.\n\nSome great photos were taken but I don't know how to get them off of our Discord server.
