Hi Lichfield Code Club members

Stu and I have set up a GutHub group account where you can create programs and share them with other  Code Club members. This would allow us to help each other if we have problems.

If you already have a GitHub account, and it's better if you do, let us know your username and we'll add you to the group. If not, then send an email to LichfieldCodeClub@gmail.com and we'll send you a password so you can login to GitHub.

This is the GitHub link  for our group https://GitHub.com/Lichfield-Code-Club

Hope to see you there soon :-)

Mark
