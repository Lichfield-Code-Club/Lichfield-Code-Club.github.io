Summary of Code Club meeting 28th June

A nice evening at today's club 

Bill worked on 'Certainly Not Flappy Bird' Unity project

Natan looked into using Javascript to create an 'Alexa' type program 

Nathaniel enjoyed programming a BBC MicroBit, I think his Dad enjoyed it too! 

Aleks and Thomas are doing some really wonderful things with python graphics and Pico electronics projects. 

All in all, our members are becoming more an more proficient with their projects, which is nice because it gives us, the STEM Ambassadors, time to sit down and talk to each of them and see what they're doing. 

All in all a nice, productive meeting
Many thanks to Bill for taking the photos
