Summary of meeting Tuesday 8th March 

Tim discovered the delights of removing supports from the 3D printed tank hull, very small spaces and precious little room to manoeuvre! 
Bill made nice progress on extending his tree objects in Blender 
Natan had fun updating our linux server, downloading minecraft client and trying to explain to Stoo and I what anti-cheats were all about, with very little comprehension on my part 
We thought we might get to the mechanical construction of the robot tank but found that the printed instructions kept referring to YouTube videos BUT ... we had no speakers!! 

All in all a great meeting with some learning opportunities for Stoo and myself.
