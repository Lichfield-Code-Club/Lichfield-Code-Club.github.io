Comments from our members and their parents

Aleks, age 13
I enjoy learning something new each week. I have more time to work on projects than at school which is never in much detail

Igor, age 20
I helped people out with problems regarding different softwares

Paul, parent
Coding club is a great way for my boys to concentrate on programming computers. Here, they can focus without distraction and receive expert and friendly advice.

Natan, age 11
I'm making a montage. I like code club because we get to code and experiment and destroy computers (digitally).

Bill, age 13
Natan, Igor, Mark, and Stoo are good friends and Mark and Stoo are both knowledgeable about code which is helpful when I have an issue.

Thomasz, age 13
I have enjoyed learning more about Python language and have used it to draw incredible pictures!

These cards will be on display at the Cosford Air Show where we hope to promote Code Club and encourage other youngsters to join clubs close to where they live.
