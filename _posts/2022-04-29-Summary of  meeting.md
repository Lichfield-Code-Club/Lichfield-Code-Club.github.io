Summary of  meeting on Tuesday 26th April

A very busy meeting. 

There's a growing interest in the BBC microbit with two young lads enjoying using scratch to program patterns on the LED matrix and testing out sensors.

Bill had an issue with is Unity project but seemed to make good progress. The tree he's working on certainly looks like a tree.

We had some issues with two PC's not connecting to the internet which marred two lads efforts to learn some python programming. They'll bring their own laptops to the next meeting and we'll get Code, Github and Python setup.

We'll make sure we have some offline projects that people can work on, as a fall back for when the internet is not available.

Tim made good progress on our robot tank, despite a spillage of shrink wrap tubing!

I didn't get time to take any photos :-(
