Interested in learning Python? Have a look at the Code Club site which has a built in Python IDE for starters. If you are a little more advanced use Visual Studio Code with the Python plug in. A good site to look at is https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/#background-and-setup 
Aleks has been using this to get a better understanding of the Pygame library.
