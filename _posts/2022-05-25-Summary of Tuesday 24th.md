Summary of Tuesday 24th of May meeting

It was a meeting when not a lot of coding was done but a lot of social interaction occurred, which is equally as good.

Natan was trying to install Unity on his linux server but he keeps running out of time. So we'll do that from home and before the next meeting.

Bill has found that his Unity and Blender projects are too large to upload to GitHub so we'll look at Google Drive and similar.

Paul, Thomasz and Aleks had issues trying to get started with the Raspberry Pi Pico and installing micropython. We will also tackle this before the next meeting

Ania was off and Kasia helped us out nicely. Thanks to Kasia we will be able to have a meeting next Tuesday, even though it's half term for many schools.

Some great photos were taken but I don't know how to get them off of our Discord server.  For those who have already joined the Discord channel https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752788182436675646/978731348766384209/unknown.png
