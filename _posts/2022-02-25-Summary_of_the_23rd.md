Summary of the 23rd February club meeting

Bill worked on modifying a tree created in blender Blender, using private web browsing and drawing graphs in Windows calculator.

Natan and Stoo had some fun with 2 BBC microbits. 
Using one to trigger alarms on the other and considered how to handle 'contact bounce' which made the transmitter send multiple connection messages.

Pav sorted our printed parts for the robot tank and determined that we had all the plastic parts.
However, Tim decided to reprint the tank hull because one of the key gear supports had partly broken off.

Pav went through the electronic components, identifying what each one was and ticking them off the list. 
It looks like we're missing a few key parts which we'll get before the next meeting.

All in all, a very good, productive and enjoyable activity.
