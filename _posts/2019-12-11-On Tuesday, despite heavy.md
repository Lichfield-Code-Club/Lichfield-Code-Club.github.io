On Tuesday, despite heavy rain several youngsters attended Code Club at Lichfield Library. Where we took a look at Python in particular using the free 'repl' services at https://repl.it/. The site lets you create programs in C#, C++, C, Python, Java, JavaScript and many more.
We looked at defining functions,  looping through lists and lists of list to create a maze program and started to add keyboard interaction.
Another lad looked at using pygame, but the startup learning curve was quite steep and so next time we'll provide a skeletal game and add functionality.
Thank you to all who came and look forward to seeing you next week.
