Summary of meeting on 13th September 

It was more of a welcome back and what have you been doing than a code club meeting but that was good in itself. 

Bill updated unity
Natan did something with linux servers and swap spaces
Alekz and Thomasz had (manually) copied a pong game which had many bugs and so they did a little debugging.
The rest of us had a good chin wag ðŸ˜Š
