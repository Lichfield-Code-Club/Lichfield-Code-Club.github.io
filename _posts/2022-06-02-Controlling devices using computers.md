Controlling devices using computers is fun and easy. At the club, which is part of the Raspberry Pi foundation, we naturally favour the Raspberry Pi Pico, although historically the arduino has been the main stay of our projects.

It's nice that the Pico only costs 6 GBP.

The photos show the pico and an LCD screen. The screen also has switches and a joystick and so could be used to create hand held games.
