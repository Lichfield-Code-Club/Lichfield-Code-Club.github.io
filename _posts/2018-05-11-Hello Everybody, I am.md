Hello Everybody, I am sorry we are unable to host our Saturday Code Club session this month. I think we will re-asses after the Library move now. Monday sessions are unaffected and next session is Monday 14th May. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions. Happy Coding, Stewart & Johnathon ðŸ˜Š
