Summary of meeting on Tuesday 31st of May

It was half term and so a few members were not able to attend, we hope they had a good time and look forward to seeing them next week.

Paul, Aleks and Thomasz made good progress on using Thonny to program a Raspberry Pi Pico and created the usual blinking LED and went on to follow the tutorials that came with the pico

Bill worked on the Cosford Air Show presentation slides making them far more presentable. Bill also took some photos of the meeting.

We got club members to fill in some cards to say what they like about the club and why they come. We'll post those separately.

All in all another good meeting and looking forward to the next one.
