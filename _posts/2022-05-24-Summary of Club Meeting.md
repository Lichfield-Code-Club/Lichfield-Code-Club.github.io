Summary of Club Meeting on Tuesday 17th May

Welcome to our latest new member Adiel, who was initially interested in designing clothes in scratch but chose to switch to programming a robot car. Quite different, but that's partly what we're about, to provide multiple avenues to explore the uses to which computers can be applied,

We're planning what to put on, and who can do what at the Cosford  Air show next month.

It was a nice hum of activity with members helping each other out and generally getting on with their projects.

Busy times
