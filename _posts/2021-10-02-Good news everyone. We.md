Good news everyone. We will soon be able to continue our Code Club at the Curborough Community centre, who have kindly offered us a slot at 5pm on Wednesdays.

We did contact Lichfield Library and they issued the following statement regarding the current situation.

                             

Thanks for calling into the library about code club today.  I hope you are keeping well. We are currently recovering our services slowly and risk assessing each area.  Unfortunately we cannot offer Code Club at this time as we are unable to offer socially distanced areas with computers for groups.  The session running at Stafford library is Raspberry Jam which is run by an independent group outside of library opening hours.  This is possible as the SP1 building is open during the evening.  Unfortunately this is not possible outside of opening hours in the Lichfield Library space.  Staffordâ€™s Code club is currently not running as they are not able to socially distance in their computer area.

We would like to re-instate Code Club at some point in the future, but the Staffordshire County Council Winter Plan is following Government guidelines and keeping social distancing, and mask wearing everywhere they can to reduce the Covid 19 risk.  When this changes we will look again at what we can offer.  It is unlikely that this will change until Spring 2022 at the earliest.
