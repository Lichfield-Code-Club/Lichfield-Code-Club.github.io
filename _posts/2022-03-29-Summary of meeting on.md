Summary of meeting on Tuesday 29th March 2022

Tonight saw another new member, Nathan. Nathan built his own Scratch project and his own Micro BIT project during the hour long session. Welcome aboard Nathan. Alex and Thomas were using Python to write a Rock, Paper, Scissors game and a turtle racing game. Bill continued work on his Blender project and Natan continued to investigate the world of Minecraft servers.

Work on the remote control Tank continued with Tim working out what connectors we need for the motors. Mark could not be with us tonight so we are looking forward to more progress next week.

As ever, thankyou to Pawel and Ania for hosting us and setting up for us.
