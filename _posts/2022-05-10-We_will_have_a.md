We will have a stand at RAF Cosford Air Show. It's the first since 2019 due to the covid epidemic.

We're trying to spread the message about how we operate and what our youngsters do and enjoy.

PLEASE COME AND SAY HELLO

We will have a number of computers with simple things for people to try out. 

Here are some photos of us at the show in 2019
