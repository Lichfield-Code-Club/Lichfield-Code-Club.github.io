Connecting Visual Studio Code to GitHub
===========================
This only has to be done once.

Firstly, if you don't have your own GitHub account please email LichfieldCodeClub@gmail.com for a username and password.

With Visual Studio Code running it can be connected to our Code Club GitHub account by pressing Ctrl+Shift+G or by clicking on the 'Source Code' symbol, 3 connected circles, in the left hand  menu.

Click on 'Clone Repository' and then 'Clone from GitHub', you'll be prompted to give permission for Visual Studio Code to connect to GitHub. Your browser will then open and again ask for Authorisation. Click on 'Continue'

Enter the login details and click 'Authorize github'. 
If you're asked which repository to clone, please use https://github.com/lichfieldcodeclub/hello-world.git

That should be it.
Let us know, here, if you have any problems
