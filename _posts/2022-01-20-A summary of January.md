A summary of January 19th meeting ...

The model wind power turbine is now at one of the club members home and being used to charge a rechargeable battery. 

Fusion360 model housing for stepper motor adjusted as the 3D printer slicing software, chitubox, was unhappy with the length of the Y axis. Will test later to see if it's now accepted 

The terrain textures component of Unity was investigated to produce grass in various shades and lighting conditions. Two of the club members worked together, one more experienced and one younger, it was rewarding to see them working collaboratively. 

A wifi dongle was fitted and configured on the single linux box we have. This allowed the OS to be updated and used to update one of the members own website.
