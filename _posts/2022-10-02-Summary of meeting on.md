Summary of meeting on 27th September

We had a great session working on Unity, MicroBit on an Apple Mac and Pong written in Python.

Lots of good interactions around debugging code, checking out our newly donated Apple Mac.

Stoo had installed Chrome_Flex on one of our PC's which previously had been unusable. It was good to get it back into use.

All in all, I'd say that we were working nicely as a group and long may it last.

We are open to new members and if you're interested please come along to the Curborough Community Centre Code Club at 5pm on each Tuesday. Look forward to meeting you :-)
