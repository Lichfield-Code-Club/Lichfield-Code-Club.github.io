Summary of meeting on Tuesday 22nd March 2022

Bill seems to be getting on nicely with his Blender work, although I wish I knew more about blender in order to help him :-( 

Natan started building an online minecraft server which he intends to setup MySQL and some anticheat services. 

Pav helped build an IDC cable for the robotic arm. Much trickier than expected and some good practical skills developed. 

Tim fitted two motors to the Robot Tank and determined we didn't have the right connectors to connect to the rest if the circuitry. These are on order and should be with us by the next meeting. 

Two new lads joined and worked on scratch and python. They came on a busy day and hopefully got enough attention for them to come again.

A busy but productive session, no time for photos!
