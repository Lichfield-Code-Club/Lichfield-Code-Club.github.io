Summary of 11th October Meeting We had a demonstration of drones from a visiting enthusiast. The members liked the way the drones could avoid obstacles, rising over hedges and tress. The 'follow' feature was entertaining how the drones could follow people even whilst they ran as fast as they could. Tried using a cheaper drone in the community centre's large hall but it refused to do what had been prepared, very frustrating. Some progress made on unity graphics and debugging pong (again).

We are open to new members and if you're interested please come along to 
Curborough Community Centre Code Club at 5:30pm each Wednesday. 
Bring a laptop with wifi capability if you can
Look forward to meeting you :-)
