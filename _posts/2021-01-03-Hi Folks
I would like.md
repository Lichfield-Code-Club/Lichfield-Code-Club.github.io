Hi Folks
I would like to recommend a YouTube channel to help complete beginners to program computers ...

Paul McWhorter has updated his Arduino tutorials on YouTube.
It's a very easy way to get to know how to program computers, or in this case microcontrollers.
It requires an Arduino kit from Elegoo, which sells on Amazon for Â£31.50 which might sound a lot but there are hundreds of things that can be done using it.
