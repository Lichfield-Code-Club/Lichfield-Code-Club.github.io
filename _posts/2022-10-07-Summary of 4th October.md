Summary of 4th October Meeting

I felt that it was a great meeting with club members helping each other and working together to solve problems, explain what they were doing and generally everyone doing something they were interested in.

I asked each member to say a few words about what they were doing. Here's Bill's ...

Bill, Tomasz, and Natan experimented with movement and sound pitching in Unity and tested their colourblindness
The results are as follows:
Bill: 4/100
Tomasz: 2/100
Natan: 25/100" (edited)
October 5, 2022

Debugging the Pong game progressed considerably, borders were created, ball movement was corrected. All in all a very useful 'debugging' session.

We're looking forward to Igor being able to help out again. He's back from Poland and keen to get involved again.

Again, thank you Bill for taking some photos this week üëç
