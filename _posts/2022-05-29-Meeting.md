As an example of how we help club members outside of the meeting.  This week we have helped Bill with his Unity project, helped Paul get started with micro python on a Raspberry Pi Pico and installed Unity on the linux PC for Natan.

We're planning what to put on our stand at the Cosford Air Show in two weeks time and will post a write up after the big day.

Many thanks to Entrust and Code Club UK for promotional materials, such as pens, badges and leaflets which we will give away at the air show.

Wish us luck as we try to spread the word of what Code Club can do for our members.
