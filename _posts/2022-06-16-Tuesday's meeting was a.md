Tuesday's meeting was a much quieter event which meant time could be spent talking with club members and seeing what they were working on.

Paul, Aleks and Thomasz have done some really good progressive random spiral coding in python as well as making good progress on programming the Raspberry Pi Pico and learning about diodes only allowing current to flow one way. Really good to see them learning so much and becoming more and more confident.

Some really in depth coding of a BBC microbit by Nathaniel. He's really quite adept with the whole microbit programnming interfaces.

Bill did some more work on the Unity system and took photos of our meeting.
