Summary of 8th November 2022 meeting

Thanks to Igor for covering Mark and Stoo's job of supervising, (who couldn't be there) as well as Ania, whose drink-making abilities have been largely disregarded in these posts.

Igor and Bill debugged gliding code in Unity.
Paul used PurpleMash, whilst Aleks and Natan coded an analogue clock.
Nathaniel and Tomaz programmed the BBC Microbit.
This week's meeting turned out well. ðŸ˜€
