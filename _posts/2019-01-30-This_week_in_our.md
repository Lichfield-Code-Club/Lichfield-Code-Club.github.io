This week in our Tuesday Code Club session we saw a BBC Micro Bit interacting with Scratch 3. Follow the link below to see how to connect your Micro Bit to Scratch.

If you have an Apple Mac or Mac Book, Bluetooth is built in. If you are using a PC, you might need to purchase a Bluetooth USB Dongle.

I will be demonstrating this at our Saturday Code Club, this coming Saturday 2nd February.
