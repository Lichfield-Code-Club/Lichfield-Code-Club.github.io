Summary of our meeting on Tuesday 15th of March

The only PC capable of running Unity was playing up and refused to boot. It kept restarting, so Bill was unable to make any progress on his tree objects. However, he and Stoo had last weeks version and were able to integrate it with Stoo's Oculus VR (Virtual Reality) head set and they had some fun moving around the virtual scene. 

Tim made great progress on the Robot tank and the main body is now assembled. The motors are next. Unfortunately we didn't have the exact motors that the design called for and the motor spindles are a little shorter than expected. Tim will investigate heating the locking nut hot enough tho melt the PLA (plastic) and embed it in the cog that it needs to hold. 

Pav and Natan further investigated minecraft anti-cheats and now Stoo and I have a reasonable grasp over what they are and why they're needed. 

Great support, as always, from the community centre staff and mums. Thank you :-)
