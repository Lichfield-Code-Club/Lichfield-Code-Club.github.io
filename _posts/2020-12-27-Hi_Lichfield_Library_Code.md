Hi Lichfield Library Code Club members and anyone else who's interested. 
We'd like people to help build our website, https://lichfield-code-club.github.io/
It'll be a good way to help youngsters learn how to code and develop collaboration skills.
We'll be using github to hold the files and serve the web pages.
We will be using Jekyll to create the web pages.

If interested please contact us on the discord channel, the link is in previous post.

Hope you all are having a good Christmas.

Mark
