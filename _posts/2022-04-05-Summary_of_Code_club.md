Summary of Code club activities for 5th April.

Tonight we welcomed another new member Henry. 
Henry got straight into Scratch and BBC Micro Bit 
programming. Bill continued with his Blender project,

Alex and Thomas wrote some more interesting Python scripts
and Nathaniel programmed the VEX IQ robot. Natan helped set up
and assisted with various IT problems including installing
drivers for our wireless dongles. Great job Natan!

Mark, Tim and Igor continued development of the Robot Tank.
We will include an in depth look at this next weeks post.
