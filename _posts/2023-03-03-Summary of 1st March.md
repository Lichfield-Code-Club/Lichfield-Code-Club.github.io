Summary of 1st March 2023
In addition to Bill's summary

A fairly quiet meeting with only 3 members attending.
Joe did some nice work on github and practised creating postings for our website, git pull requests and merges, and seeing the website updated in almost real time.
Bill worked on his unity platform game and generally helped out.
Oscar enjoyed working on his project
