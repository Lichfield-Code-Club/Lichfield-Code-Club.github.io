Summary of 16th February meeting
Bill had issues retrieving his work and looked at a few aspects of Blender. Natan and Igor worked on updating our linux server and investigating some network connection issues. Tim and I reviewed the progress on our robot tank and identified what still needed to be 3d printed and which electronic components we had.
