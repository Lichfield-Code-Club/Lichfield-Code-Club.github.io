Further to the suggestion to install Python on your laptop, here are the steps I went through
Using web browser, download the installer: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-webinstall.exe
Double click on the downloaded file to make it run
Check the 'Add Python 3.8 to PATH' at the bottom of the page
Choose the 'Install Now' option
After a few minutes there will be the option to 'Disable path length limit' which should be done, by clicking on it.
There's an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) called 'Idle' but I couldn't find a desktop icon, so I typed 'idle' in the windows search bar, look for a magnifying glass, I then 'pinned to task bar' and 'opened' it
Type this, and press enter, to prove it works:    print('Hello World')
To end or 'get out' type: exit()
