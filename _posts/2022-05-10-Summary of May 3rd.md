Summary of May 3rd meeting

Another very busy meeting. 
Lots of support needed, and given. 
Bill's Unity project is doing very well with recognisable blossom on his trees. 
Alex and Thomas made some progress with python 
Pav and Tim considered how we might connect a robot arm to a nano or raspberry pi
Henry and Nathaniel investigated the Microbit sensors a bit more and seemed to be enjoying making thinks blink and whir
Natan installed Unity on a linux server
Igor gave lots of support and encouragement to all.
