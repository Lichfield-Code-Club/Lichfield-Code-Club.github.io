Summary of our meeting on Tuesday 5th of July

Bill had some issues with his parallax settings in Unity which resulted in display update issues with gaps between frames which eventually caught up. We couldn't resolve the issues during the meeting but will try and find time to sort them out before the next meeting.

Natan had issues with his speech/phrase recognition software, which we'll try and reolve before the next meeting.

Alekx and Thomasz further progressed their pico electronics where they were emulating pedestrian crossing, althought the sound didn't work. Also some nice progress on the random but structured vectors graphics drawings.

Nataniel and his Dad investigated two BBC MicroBits talking, wirelessly, to each other.
