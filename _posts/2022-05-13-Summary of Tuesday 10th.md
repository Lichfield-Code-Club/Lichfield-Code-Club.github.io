Summary of Tuesday 10th May Meeting

Another very busy meeting. 
Natan updated his linux server and sorted out some ethernet driver issues 
Bill's Unity project is doing very well , the blossom on his trees is still impressive. 
Aleks and Tomasz made some progress with python 
Tim had some conundrums with the robot tank and resolved to contact the instructables author. 
The two youngest members were absent due to ill health.

A lot of thought went into what we need to do to be ready for the Cosford Air show
