We visited Stafford Library on Tuesday 14th September where Cerys Lock was hosting a raspberry jam event.
Although the visit was brief, it was a fact finding mission to see what restrictions were in place to enable
the group to meet. Mask wearing was encouraged and there were plenty of hand sanitizer stations dotted around.
The night saw around 15 attendees demonstrating various Raspberry Pi projects.

We are going to approach Lichfield Library in the coming week to see if are able to resume our Code Club meetings.
I will post the outcome of our meeting as soon as I have any details.
