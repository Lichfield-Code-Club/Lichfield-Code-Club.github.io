Good news everybody. Lichfield Library are re-opening on Monday 20th July. We won't be able to host Code Club just yet, however, the situation is being reviewed. Our apologies for not having any online activities. Hopefully those of you are keen about programming have been using Scratch and searching the internet for interesting things to do. I am going to post some BBC Micro bit stuff as there are some new kits available that are pocket money priced and I will be demonstrating these when we next meet. Please feel free to message us with any Code Club type questions. Kind regards to you all. Stay Safe.
