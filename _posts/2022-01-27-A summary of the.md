A summary of the meeting on Wednesday 26th January ...

Bill worked on Blender creating tree/grass assets to use with Unity

Igor used Fusion360 and adjusted his design of our robot arm support to accommodate the signal connector we'd not seen in the original image. We'll print this on a resin 3D printer and hopefully have something to hold up a camera and, using computer vision, identify and follow a person in a crowded room.

Pav and Igor worked on making a robot arm move properly, found where the unfitted gear should be and got everything working nicely.

Stoo had managed to get hold of a microbit v2, which Natan had great fun with, using scratch to write programs that tested sound thresholds for triggering responses. 

Tim had used his Creatility 3D printer to create some tank tracks for a robot tank project we've started to work on, based on an instructables guide. https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-FPV-Arduino-RC-Tank-With-Controller/ The tracks were amazing, printed as a single print the linkages worked, as in moved fairly easily, we'll need to add some grease to make the track move more freely but unbelievable that you can print something with moving parts.
