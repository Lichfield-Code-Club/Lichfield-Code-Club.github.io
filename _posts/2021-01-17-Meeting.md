Hi everyone, just a note to say we are working on our online presence and now have a Discord presence. This is a social media server that let's us exchange ideas and code. One of our young coders is trying their hand at web design. Check out lichfieldcodeclub.uk 

Remember, we have a Club Page on the main Code Club Site, where you can find lots of projects to have a go at. I am going to investigate the possibility of having virtual Code Club meetings on Zoom. This would allow us to see and speak to each other and share ideas and projects. I need to do a bit of research on this first to make sure we stick to the guidelines etc and that we can do this in a safe way that respects your privacy.
