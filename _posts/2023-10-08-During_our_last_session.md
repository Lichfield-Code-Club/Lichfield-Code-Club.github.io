During our last session on  4th October, we coded games in python, C# and Unity and also dabbled with Discord 
Bots.

Why not drop in on Wednesday 11th October to see what we are up to. The sessions are free and we usually have two STEM Ambassadors on hand to answer any questions and lend a helping hand with all matters code, where we can. If you have a laptop, please feel free to bring it along. We do have several desktop computers, a Mac Book and various embedded computing devices such as BBC Micro Bits and Raspberry Pi Pico.
