With Corona Virus still preventing Code Club meetings, it would be nice to supplement our Facebook and Discord presence with examples of our members work.

* [Facebook][facebook] ... Primarily managed by Stewart and Mark
	- This is where we make announcements and feedback on Club activities. 

* [Discord][discord] ... Collaborative support
	- This is where we can be more interactive and help resolve any problems that we encounter. 
	- It's user friendly, interactive and gives speedy, sometimes instant support if people are actively using the service.


To add new posts to this website, simply send an email, or post the information into the Discord 'posts' channel.
Ideally, we would like members to create content via github, but that maybe too tricky to set up, whilst we can't meet face to face.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. 
If you have any Jekyll questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
